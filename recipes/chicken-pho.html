    <h1>Pho Ga (Chicken Pho)</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is an easy and quick recipe to make chicken pho or 
                Pho Ga. If you don't have a lot of time to make beef pho and 
                still want similar flavours, then this is the recipe for you.
            </p>
            <p>There is no really <em>correct</em> way of eating pho. I'm 
                of the opinion that people are allowed to do what they want 
                with their own food. For me, I like to taste the broth as it 
                was meant to be tasted, and dip slies of meat into a tray of 
                hoisin and Sriracha on the side. Still get the sauce punch 
                occasionally, and get the broth how it was meant to be.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak your rice noodles in boiling water before you start 
                prepping</li>
                <li>on a roasting tray, lay a sheet of aluminium foil and 
                    put aromatics on top. Roast in the oven on 375-400F for 
                    15 - 30 minutes or until dark brown.</li>
                <li>Add the aromatics, spices and broth ingredients into 
                    a large stock pot and bring to a boil on high heat. Once 
                    it hits a boil, lower the heat to low and cook the chicken 
                    for 25 - 40 minutes until the chicken is cooked all the way 
                    through. It is important to not have the broth on a hard boil 
                    because it will make the broth cloudy.</li>
                <li>remove the chicken when cooked and rinse in cold water 
                    for a minute to cool. This will prevent the chicken from 
                    turning dark. Once cooled, shred chicken into small pieces.
                </li>
                <li>Your rice noodles should be mostly cooked now, you can 
                    strain your noodles. Get a smaller pot of boiling water 
                    and blanch the noodles for 30 seconds and it will be fully 
                    cooked.
                </li>
                <li>Assemble your bowl with your noodles, chicken and any 
                    of the accoutrements of your choice. Ladle in your broth 
                    and enjoy!
                </li>
