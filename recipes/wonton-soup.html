    <h1>Wonton Soup</h1>

    <img src="../images/wonton-soup.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you've ever had store bought frozen wontons or wontons from
            a good value Chinese place that probably uses frozen wontons,
            you will be amazed how different homemade ones are. The main 
            difference is the texture of the filling - because homemade 
            wontons are just made with pure <em>fresh</em> ingredients!
        </p>
        <p>I think wontons are one of those things that many people 
            don't think to make, assuming they are really tedious and 
            take ages. But they don't! The wonton filling takes minutes 
            and wrapping the wontons is quite fast if you use my method!
        </p>
